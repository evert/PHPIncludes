PHP includes v0.1 

This is a simple script that traverses your sourcecode and attempts and create
an 'includes' file.

Using an includes file instead of for example autoload can have significant
performance benefits.

Usage: 
  - Download PHPIncludes
  - Run with "php phpincludes.php [directory] [outputfile]"
 
If the outputfile is not supplied, output is sent to STDOUT.

TODO:
  - Files with no classes or interfaces are ignored, those need to be added
  - Allow checking for files with extensions other than .php
  - Allow adding a 'template'. Right now it's just a file starting wiht <?php
  - Split up into classes
  - Create a pear package
